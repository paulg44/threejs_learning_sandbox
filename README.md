# threejs_learning_sandbox

A playground repository for learning three.js before making a new 3D portfolio
Currently using no frontend frameworks such as react to learn on. I will look into React Three Fibre once I have done a couple of vanilla three.js tutorials

I will also be using vite as the build tool, something new I haven't encountered before

Currently completing the three.js manual documentation before I experiment on my own
